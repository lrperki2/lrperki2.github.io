## Final Thoughts
Nearing completion of this course, I would now approach data science problems differently. From a tech standpoint, I might consider leveraging R and its many great packages, such as, `tidyverse`, `rmarkdown`, `caret`, and `shiny`, amongst others.  Utilizing vectorized functions and custom functions can add efficiency and flexibility to a project, as well. From a methodology standpoint, I might employ supervised learning techniques to make predictions or unsupervised learning techniques to observe patterns.

In my future career, I hope to work directly on data science projects as a statistician or analyst. Asking and answering interesting questions that can impact business decisions is an exciting prospect. As I continue to gain experience, I hope to learn more about machine learning and delve more into the theory behind the math, so as to apply optimal modeling techniques for a given job, as well as address a broader range of data science problems.
