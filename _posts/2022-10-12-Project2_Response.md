# Project 2 Response

## Summary

The second project focused on learning how to interact with an API and served as an introduction into collaboration on data science projects. We built a function that contacted an API endpoint with a url, then converted the information into a usable format. We integrated modifications on the endpoint that could be used as parameters to subset the data by different variables directly from the API. We then analyzed the data numerically and graphically using summaries, tables, and plots. For the collaboration component, we used git directly through R to pull down files, stage commits, resolve merge conflicts, and push updated files to a shared repo on github.

## Reflection

The process had its share of challenges. Some APIs we looked at originally were hard to parse through and determine the structure and usability of the data, particularly in regards to the assignment. In some cases it seemed like there were endlessly nested structures or links to other links. In terms of programming, it was difficult to balance making user-friendly choices like feedback loops or converting invalid inputs in the background with having overly complicated code. As the project was built as one larger function, sometimes the nesting was hard to track with regards to overall purpose.

If I were to approach a similar project in the future, I think I would dedicate more time to doing initial research. We were able to pivot our plan without too much time loss, but it still could have saved us some headaches in the end. Overall, still a great learning experience, and I hope I'll take on other projects using APIs in the future.
