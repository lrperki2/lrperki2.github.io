# Project 1 Response

This first project focused on reading in and manipulating data sets, writing generic functions to reproduce workflow, and communicating the thought process behind the code.

Some of the key takeaways were learning how to write function definitions, becoming familiarized with the `dplyr` package, learning about the interaction between classes and functions, and practicing assembling smaller code chunks into a cohesive project.  

If I were to redo the project, I would experiment more often. I tended to fixate on finding optimal solutions quickly, but with more experimentation, maybe I would pick up on some additional use cases for various functions. Overall, it was a great learning experience.
