# Data Science Articles Response

The title of data scientist could encompass a variety of roles within an organization, but in a general sense, it is someone who is involved in the process of using the scientific method in conjunction with data analysis to drive decision-making. Depending on the size of the data scientist’s team or scope of a given project, the scientist’s responsibilities could include one or more of the following: gathering, cleansing, transforming, or exploring data; building and adapting models; or interpreting and communicating results to stakeholders. A data scientist’s expertise can be categorized into three areas: statistics, programming, and domain/subject knowledge. As a hybridized role, a data scientist may focus more on programming and less on mathematics and theory in comparison to a statistician, and conversely, a data scientist may focus more on statistics and less on programming in comparison to a programmer. Although both statisticians and data scientists analyze data to influence decisions, their processes can differ in that a statistician may iterate on one model until it fits the data, whereas a data scientist may compare multiple models to select the one with the best fit.

Currently, I believe my skills align more with that of a data scientist than a statistician, as I do not have the requisite mathematical background, but I do have some data analysis and programming experience. Eventually, I hope to close that gap in my math background to be able to fill either role.
