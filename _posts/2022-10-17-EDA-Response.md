# Exploratory Data Analysis Articles Response

When conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis, the primary goal is to give an overview or broad summary of the data, as well as point out any meaningful or interesting trends, patterns, or anomalies in the data. Three key areas on which to focus are the shape, center, and spread.

An effective approach in determining these measures is to first plot the data. If the data is numeric, plots can give an indication of shape, i.e., whether or not the distribution has skew, and if so, in which direction. If the data is continuous, a histogram can help determine the modality of the distribution, whereas a boxplot can easily reveal outliers; it is important to pay special attention to both outliers and missing values. To better understand the data, one might try to determine reasons for outliers or missing data, as well as determine what those data represent, contextually.

An important method of quantifying the spread is to use the five-number summary. This is a simple way to find the minimum and maximum values, as well as see where the middle 50% of the data lies. Comparing measures of center like the mean to the median from the five-number summary is another technique that can be used to determine if a distribution has skew, while looking at measures of spread like the IQR and standard deviation are ways of quantifying variability.

A useful method in spotting patterns in categorical data is to utilize contingency tables, and as a final approach, one might look for possible relationships in numeric data by using a scatter plot or correlation matrix.
